Javascript client library for accessing the [Typesense HTTP API](https://github.com/typesense/typesense). Follows the API spec [here](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-api-spec).

This library can be used both on the server-side and on the client-side. The library's [source](/src) is in ES6 and during build time, we transpile it to ES5 and generate two artifacts - [one](/lib) that can be used on the server-side and [another](/dist) that uses [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and can be used on the client side.

## Installation

#### Install via npm

```sh
$ npm install typesense
```

#### Include the minified JS file for use in the browser directly

```html
<script src="dist/typesense.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

Read the documentation here: [https://typesense.org/api/](https://typesense.org/api/)

Here are some examples that show you how the client works: [doc/examples](doc/examples)

Tests are also a good place to know how the the library works internally: [test](test)

**Note: When using this library client-side, please be sure to use the `search-only-api-key` instead of the `master` API key.**

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies. Then run `npm test` to run the linter and tests.
